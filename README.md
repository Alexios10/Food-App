# Food App

Food App is a single-page web application built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. It was my first project after learning the basics of JavaScript and React.js. The app allows users to explore different types of food and filter them based on categories and price ranges.

## Features

- **Filtering**: Users can easily filter food options based on categories and price ranges.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: The app efficiently fetches images and data from a separate file to populate the components dynamically.
- **Responsive Design**: Food App is designed to provide a seamless experience across devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

To set up and run the Food App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/FoodApp.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Access the app in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`
